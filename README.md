# 🚖 Cab Booking System Analysis – SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This SQL-based project focuses on analyzing data from a cab booking system to extract actionable insights related to ride trends, user behavior, driver performance, and business efficiency. By writing and executing optimized SQL queries, we derive metrics that support data-driven decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze ride booking patterns by date, time, and location
* Track customer and driver activity
* Identify peak demand hours and zones
* Evaluate ride duration, distance, and fare distributions
* Calculate revenue metrics and operational KPIs
* Monitor cancellation and no-show trends
* Analyze customer feedback and ratings

---

## 🗃️ Datasets Used

* **Trips Table**: `trip_id`, `user_id`, `driver_id`, `pickup_time`, `drop_time`, `distance_km`, `fare_amount`, `status`
* **Users Table**: `user_id`, `user_type` (customer/driver), `signup_date`, `city`
* **Ratings Table**: `trip_id`, `rating`, `feedback_text`
* **Promotions Table**: `promo_code`, `discount_value`, `used_in_trip_id`

---

## 🧮 Key SQL Queries

* Total rides booked per day/week/month
* Revenue per city, driver, or time period
* Average trip duration and distance
* Cancellation rate and no-show trends
* Top-performing drivers and most active customers
* Most popular pickup/drop-off zones
* Impact of promotional codes on ride frequency

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used

* MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server
* DBMS / Workbench** for query execution
* Excel / CSV for initial data imports
* Optional: Power BI or Tableau for visualization

---

## 📊 Output & Insights

* Cleaned and well-structured SQL query outputs
* Performance metrics and operational dashboards
* Insightful reports for business recommendations

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements
